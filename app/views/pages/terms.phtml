        <p>If you encounter another user who is violating any of these rules, please report this activity to a staff member
            via discord.</p>

        <h5><strong>3. Termination and Other Sanctions</strong></h5>

        <p>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or RN. RN may terminate your access and use of any RN
            Services or your RN Account if RN determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been
            otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of RN Services associated with your RN Account. When practical,
            RN will notify you of the termination. If your RN Account is terminated, you will not have access to your RN
            Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any RN Service again. Upon termination,
            your license under this Agreement also shall terminate, and all of your listings will be removed. If you have
            active premium, you will not be refunded in full, or in part.</p>

        <h5><strong>4. Listing Rules &amp; Guidelines</strong></h5>
        <ul>
            <li>All information must be relevant to the game server, and may not include anything that goes against Section 2.</li>
            <li>False or misleading advertisements will result in termination in accordance with Section 3.</li>
            <li>Images must be related to your listing, and not contain anything that goes against Section 2.</li>

            and your account may be terminated in accordance with Section 3.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><strong>5. Use of Data / Data Collection</strong></h5>
        <p>When using a RN service, RN may collect data from your computer or device, including information
        about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address), system interactions, and hardware. We
        do not store this data, and we do not share this data with anyone. We use this information to provide you with
        the best possible experience on your platform, improve our products and services, and trouble shoot bugs. (mostly
        the latter).</p>

        <h5><strong>6. Paypal/Payment Requirements</strong></h5>
        <p>Purchases made on the website are subject to PayPal's terms of service. A verified account is not required,
            but highly recommended to prevent issues in the future. The account used to make the purchase must be yours,
            and in your own name, and owned by you explicitly. All purchases are made in USD currency. Any attempt to
            dispute the payment wrongfully (such as an unauthorized claim or item not received when it was legit), may
            result in termination of your account in accordance with Section 3.</p>

        <h5><strong>7. Changes to this agreement</strong></h5>
        <p>RN may modify this Agreement from time to time, so please review it frequently. For RN players who accepted a
            version of this Agreement prior to modification, the revisions will become effective 30 days after posting
            at rune-nexus.com/terms. Your continued use of RN Services means you accept the changes. Once you accept
            a version of the Agreement, we will not enforce future material changes without your express agreement to them.
            If you are asked to accept material changes to this Agreement and you decline to do so, you may not be able
            to continue to use the RN Service provided.</p>
